# Batu Eren

Computer Science student at **TU Delft**.  
I build performance-oriented systems in **C++**, work on **graphics & simulations**, and keep public notes on what I'm learning.

---

## What I'm working on

- **Lock-free data structures**  
  Single-producer / single-consumer ring buffer with custom memory ordering and performance benchmarks.

- **Simulation & graphics projects**  
  Procedural OpenGL environments with instanced foliage, wind shaders, terrain generation, and real-time rendering.

- **Systems & performance**  
  Profiling, cache behavior, concurrency, and low-latency design.

---

## Selected projects

- **SPSC Ring Buffer (C++)**  
  Wait-free queue implementation with detailed benchmarking against standard and Boost alternatives.

- **N-Body Simulation**  
  Simulation mass objects in space using a Barnes-Hut tree. C++ and OpenGL

- **Procedural Environment Renderer**  
  Python + OpenGL project featuring instanced vegetation, custom shaders, and large-scale scene rendering.

_(More details on the Projects page.)_
